Overview
--------
Web Bio Blocks is a website that is a tool to aid in gathering and processing information from multiple bioinformatics
websites. The premise of this tool is to have a datapath where a user can place different blocks and connect them together
in order to create a workflow. That workflow is then compiled and run and the result is passed back to the user. The
blocks fall into two categories, website and logical blocks.
